Backend runs on port 8082. If you need to change this, you also have to change in src/app/configuration/configuration.service.ts

### Running the application:
* Clone the repository.
* Install node modules, run `npm i` in root of the project.
* Run `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
* Run backend (instruction in backend's REAMDE.md).
